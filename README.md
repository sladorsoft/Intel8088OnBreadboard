# 16-bit Intel x86 breadboard computer tutorial

This repository holds all the source code and other resources used in my tutorial series on **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/SladorSoft)**.

You can find the source code used in each video in the **src** directory and a schematic of each contraption in **schematics**.
I use [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) to create them.
