# 16-bit Intel x86 breadboard computer tutorial

This repository holds all the source code and other resources used in my tutorial series on **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/SladorSoft)**.

You can find the source code used in each video in the **src** directory and a schematic of each contraption in **schematics**.
They have been created with [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/). Please note, that I have been using **version 6**, so the schematics may not be down-compatible with the older versions of KiCad.
There are also PDF versions of each of the schematics included.

For more details visit my website **[slador.uk](https://slador.uk/)**
